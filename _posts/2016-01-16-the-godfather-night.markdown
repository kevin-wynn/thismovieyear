So this may be a surprise to some since, it seems. If you're a movie lover, then you've seen all the Godfather movies. Well. I had not, until recently.

So I decided to make it a weekend thing, or at least one day of the week. I take that back it sort of involved a decent amount of effort and time. So the idea was to rock out a huge Italian feast amongst watching all of the movies back to back. So I was up as early as I could manage rolling out the dough for croissants ( Yeah I know that's not even Italian but who cares this is my story not yours ).

Up first early in the morning was Part 1...

## The Godfather

<i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i>

###When organized crime family patriarch Vito Corleone barely survives an attempt on his life, his youngest son, Michael, steps in to take care of the would-be killers, launching a campaign of bloody revenge.

This movie really set up the tone perfectly. It was slow when it needed to be slow and it was gripping when it needed that. The scenes I had heard everyone telling me about, the horse head, etc. Just spot on. This movie really took the cake from the three to be honest. And there's something about watching a movie in the morning that puts me in a good mood for the rest of the day. I recommend it, its great therapy.

Also having hand rolled and crafted croissants baked freshly doesn't hurt the situation either. I recommend that too.

## The Godfather: Part 2

<i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i>

###The continuing saga of the Corleone crime family tells the story of a young Vito Corleone growing up in Sicily and in 1910s New York; and follows Michael Corleone in the 1950s as he attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba

Of course its really hard to follow up on what we were delivered with the first movie. But when it comes to sequels they did it right. It was just as intense as the first, slightly toned down though.

Hey lets also introduce part 2 of the meals, we had a white wine paired with a nice mushroom risotto. I also realize I'm not putting as much words into this post as I did with the Nic Cage marathon, that's just because I did this like 2 months ago and I've sort of forgotten most of all the details I wanted to toss in here.

No one reads this shit anyways, just look at the pictures and the stars.

## The Godfather: Part 3

<i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i>

###In the midst of trying to legitimize his business dealings in 1979 New York and Italy, aging mafia don Michael Corleone seeks forgiveness for his sins while taking a young protege under his wing.

I mean this movie was basically just a bunch of old white Italians sitting around talking. BUT I made homemade ravioli that was stuffed with spinach and ricotta cheese, all together with a homemade Italian sausage and meat sauce. HOLY-FUCKING-SHIT people seriously just take a day and do this for fucks sake it was so goddamn good.

<div class="col-md-4 pull-right"><img src="/assets/images/article_assets/godfather_night/ravioli.png"></div>

But the movie was meh, I mean c'mon it was pretty meh. But hey, the food overall was dope af. If you're going to make an Italian dinner this is a pretty perfect set of movies to watch alongside. Granted you can stop at part 2, that would be a wise decision. Put on The Big Night instead with Stanley Tucci, that's a wonderful watch.

Speaking of which you know he's a cook too? He has like two cookbooks out, that's pretty wild.

Maybe I should do something involving him... Julia and Julia... Devil Wears Prada, I mean the guys done some good stuff.

Anywho, take care homie.
