overview: Dr. Michael Cayle thought leaving the chaotic lifestyle of New York City behind for the quiet, small town of Ashborough would bring his family closer together. Soon after arriving, however, he discovers the town's deepest secret, a terrifying and controlling race of creatures that live amongst the darkness in the woods behind his home.
